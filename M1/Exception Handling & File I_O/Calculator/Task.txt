Objective: Practice try-catch blocks, multiple catch blocks, and common exceptions.
Requirements:
Create a console calculator that:

Takes two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /) from user input
Handles these exceptions properly:

FormatException - Invalid number format
DivideByZeroException - Division by zero
OverflowException - Number too large/small
General Exception - Any other error


Uses a loop to allow multiple calculations
Exits when user types "exit"

Expected Output:

Enter first number: 10
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): /
Enter second number: 0
Error: Cannot divide by zero!

Enter first number: 15
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: abc
Error: Invalid number format. Please enter a valid number.

Enter first number: exit
Calculator closed.
